# Bank System OOP (C++)

This is a small, console-based banking management system written in C++14. The project was built mainly for learning and to demonstrate my understanding of object-oriented programming and menu-driven applications in C++. It features a simple text interface for managing clients, handling transactions, and basic user management.

## Features

- **Client Management:**  
  Add, update, delete, and search for clients.

- **Transactions:**  
  Deposit, withdraw, and check total balances.

- **User Management:**  
  Basic login, registration, and user management.

- **Menu Navigation:**  
  Clear, text-based menus and input validation for a smooth user experience.

## Why this project?

This project is not intended for real-world use, but rather as a showcase of my C++ and OOP skills. It helped me practice class design, static methods, and modular code organization.

## How to run

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 (or any C++14-compatible IDE).
2. Build the project.
3. Run the executable from within the IDE.
